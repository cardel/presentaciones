  abstract = {Empirical software engineering research needs research guidelines
              to improve the research and reporting processes. We propose a
              preliminary set of research guidelines aimed at stimulating
              discussion among software researchers. They are based on a review
              of research guidelines developed for medical researchers and on our
              own experience in doing and reviewing software engineering
              research. The guidelines are intended to assist researchers,
              reviewers, and meta-analysts in designing, conducting, and
              evaluating empirical studies. Editorial boards of software
              engineering journals may wish to use our recommendations as a basis
              for developing guidelines for reviewers and for framing policies
              for dealing with the design, data collection, and analysis and
              reporting of empirical studies.},
