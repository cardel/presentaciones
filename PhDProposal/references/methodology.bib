  abstract = {Empirical software engineering research needs research guidelines
              to improve the research and reporting processes. We propose a
              preliminary set of research guidelines aimed at stimulating
              discussion among software researchers. They are based on a review
              of research guidelines developed for medical researchers and on our
              own experience in doing and reviewing software engineering
              research. The guidelines are intended to assist researchers,
              reviewers, and meta-analysts in designing, conducting, and
              evaluating empirical studies. Editorial boards of software
              engineering journals may wish to use our recommendations as a basis
              for developing guidelines for reviewers and for framing policies
              for dealing with the design, data collection, and analysis and
              reporting of empirical studies.},

  abstract = {Mutation testing realizes the idea of using artificial defects to
              support testing activities. Mutation is typically used as a way to
              evaluate the adequacy of test suites, to guide the generation of
              test cases, and to support experimentation. Mutation has reached a
              maturity phase and gradually gains popularity both in academia and
              in industry. This chapter presents a survey of recent advances,
              over the past decade, related to the fundamental problems of
              mutation testing and sets out the challenges and open problems for
              the future development of the method. It also collects advices on
              best practices related to the use of mutation in empirical studies
              of software testing. Thus, giving the reader a
              “mini-handbook”-style roadmap for the application of mutation
              testing as experimental methodology.},
