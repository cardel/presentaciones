@masterthesis{Tokos2023,
   abstract = {Web applications and services are widely used today. Security is an important factor since web applications are accessed via the internet. Web services often expose their functionality through web application programming interfaces (API), and a common type of API is REST API (or RESTful API), which is an API that follows the representational state transfer architecture. Vulnerabilities in these interfaces can lead to security breaches. Therefore, they must be secure and reliable. Thoroughly testing APIs is a very time-consuming task, but there are ways to automate it, and one option is fuzz testing. In this thesis, the fuzzing tools Fuzz-lightyear, Schemathesis, and RESTler are evaluated to determine if they are effective at finding faults in REST APIs. All three tools can generate and run test cases based on OpenAPI specifications. The evaluation is based on the performance of the tools in a series of experiments. The experiments involve executing the fuzzing tools against three different APIs and comparing the results. The metrics that are used for the evaluation include the number of server errors (Test cases that return a server error) found, the number of semantic errors (Test cases that fail because of a mismatch between the OpenAPI specification and the test case response), execution time, and the number of requests sent. The experiment results show that Schemanthesis excels at finding semantic errors, while RESTler is better at finding server errors. Fuzz-lightyear found no server errors and fewer semantic errors than Schemathesis but had a short execution time. In conclusion, RESTler and Schemathesis are effective at finding faults when fuzz testing in APIs, while Fuzz-lightyear is not.},
